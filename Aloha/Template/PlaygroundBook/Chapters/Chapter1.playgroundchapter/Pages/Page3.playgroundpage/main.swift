 # Aloha: ☀️ ⛱
 Hello, my name is Anderson, I'm 22 years old and I'm a student at IFCE - Apple Developer Academy in Fortaleza - Brazil. I learned inside, how to change the world around me, through what moves and inspires me. Simple ideas when well executed can bring a smile in these difficult times. Through my work, I want to get to know cultures from around the world and produce solutions with personality that move and inspire people.
 
 # Motivation: 👩‍👧‍👦 🏄🏾‍♂️

 I love my family and one sport in particular, surfing. We have been in social isolation for 2 months and it has been difficult not to be able to practice what I love. But it's becoming even more difficult for my sister Laura, who is autistic, to deal with isolation. Thinking about having fun and educating all children, especially autistic children, who are experiencing difficulties today, I created this playground, making surfing an accessible sport for all of them.
