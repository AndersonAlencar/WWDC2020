 # Do what inspires you, even when you're away ‚òÄÔ∏èüèñ
  
Hello, my name is Anderson and for the past few months I have been experiencing social isolation.
Millions of people needed to stay at home and we get discouraged without being able to do activities
that we love and that inspire us. Can you imagine what it's like to be without doing what inspires you
for a long time? This challenge is much greater for autistic children. The interruption of sections with
psychologists and occupational therapies can make them very anxious, stressed and even aggressive, with
difficulty in resocialization. It is very important activities to work on their motor coordination and
cognition, so that they do not regress in their mental state. Thinking about what I love to do most, being
with my family and surfing, I prepared activities to entertain and inspire all children, especially autistic
children, so that they can always do what they love, even when they are away.
