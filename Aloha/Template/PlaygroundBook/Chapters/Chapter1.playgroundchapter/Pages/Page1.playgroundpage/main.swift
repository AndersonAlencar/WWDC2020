Laura is learning to surf with her friends and was invited to a party by her octopus friend, the whole marine kingdom will be there and it will be a lot of fun if we catch a wave to get there. But first, you need to complete a challenge, when you get there, you will have the opportunity to meet them all! . Are you ready ?
